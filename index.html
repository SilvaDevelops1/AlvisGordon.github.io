                    <h2 class="section-heading">why IT?</h2>
        <p>Choosing to pursue a degree in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) was a natural step for me, given my deep-rooted passion for technology and problem-solving. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by the way technology shapes our world, driving innovation and connecting people in ways that were once unimaginable. This curiosity led me to spend countless hours self-teaching JavaScript, building Discord bots, and experimenting with various tech projects. As I gained more experience, particularly in building PCs and gaming towers, I realized that my interest extended beyond just gaming—I wanted to understand and contribute to the broader IT and computing industry.</p>
        <p>ICT offers me the perfect blend of creativity and technical challenge. It allows me to explore different areas of technology, from software development to data analysis, and apply these skills in practical, real-world scenarios. The dynamic nature of the field excites me because there’s always something new to learn and new challenges to tackle. By pursuing ICT, I am equipping myself with the knowledge and skills necessary to innovate, solve complex problems, and contribute to a field that is continuously evolving. My goal is to not only master these skills but also to use them to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.</p>
