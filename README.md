This website is a personal project that I created for school but will also use this as a mine website for all my projects and anything else i feel like. It serves as a platform for showcasing everything about me, including my projects, skills, and experiences. I utilized GitHub Pages to host and run this website.

I will warn you early before veiwing this is my first ever website im more used to programing discord bots but im learning as i go so if anything is broken just raise an issue.

To set up your own GitHub Pages site, you can follow the step-by-step guide provided by GitHub: [GitHub Pages Setup Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)
