                        Welcome to the project hub, where you’ll find a collection of all my projects—both from university and beyond. Each project includes a brief overview of its purpose, functionality, build date, and any cool APIs or technologies I used. Just click on the links to explore that part of the site or visit a separate page where the project is hosted.

                    I regularly update this archive with every new project I’m working on, so feel free to check back often to see what’s new. If you’d like to stay in the loop, you can also sign up for <a href="http://example.com">my newsletter</a> to get updates whenever a new project is added. Whether it’s something I built from scratch or a project I contributed to, you’ll find it all here.

                Enjoy exploring!

                        Page Created: August 13th, 2024, 11:00 AM

This page was created to serve as a comprehensive archive of my university work, including labs, essays, and other academic projects. The purpose of this archive is to provide a professional and easily accessible showcase of my skills and accomplishments. By organizing my work in a clear and readable format, I aim to offer potential employers and collaborators a transparent view of my abilities and the breadth of my experience.

While the page was initially built on August 13th, 2024, it is being continuously updated with new projects and work as I complete them. This archive not only serves as a personal record but also as a way for businesses and professionals to verify my skills and review the quality of my work. It’s a cool and efficient way to publicly display my achievements, ensuring that anyone interested in my background can easily access proof of what I’ve done.

To return to this page from any other section, simply click on the back button on the header menu, and you’ll be brought back here quickly.

                    <p> 
                        This page is dedicated to showcasing the Discord bots I’ve created over the years. You’ll find a list of all my bots here, complete with invite links so you can add them to your servers. Each bot also has a link to its dashboard for easy management, as well as a GitHub repository link where you can explore the code behind it.

I’ve been making Discord bots since I was ten, and it’s what first sparked my passion for programming and IT. Teaching myself JavaScript through bot development laid the foundation for my journey into the tech world, and this page is a reflection of that experience.

Note: Some of my bots may not function as expected due to Discord’s recent updates to Discord.js, and others have been discontinued. Unfortunately, I’ve lost track of my first few bots, but you’ll find the most recent one here, along with any new bots I create going forward.

Feel free to explore, try out the bots, and dive into the code—whether you’re interested in seeing what I’ve built or just curious about the process.

                    <h2><a id="section3"></a>Silva's Game review page</h2>
                    <p>
                        This page is dedicated to my written reviews of games that I’ve either logged extensive hours in or fully completed. I’ll be covering every Call of Duty game I’ve played, and all future releases will be added as well. Each review will include a detailed score based on several factors: pricing, content, story, game mechanics, replayability, and community ranking.
                        
                        You’ll also be able to filter the reviews to view the best overall scored games. The community ranking feature allows you to contribute your own score based on these factors. The site will calculate an average score from the community’s input, and your comments on why you rated the game as you did will be displayed at the bottom of each review article.
                        
                        Note: This page is still a work in progress. It was created on August 13th, 2024, and you’ll initially only see the first few uploads as I ensure everything works as intended.
                        
                        Stay tuned for more reviews and features!

                    <h2><a id="section4"></a> Silva's Tech review page</h2>
                    <p> 
                        This page is where I’ll be posting reviews of various tech products, mainly focusing on Apple devices and other gadgets I own. I’ll also include detailed reviews of my PC setup, complete with specs and a video on how to build it. The scoring system for these reviews will be slightly different from the game reviews, focusing on user-friendliness, pricing, future-proofing, usefulness, and an overall score.

Just like with the game reviews, you’ll have the ability to contribute your own scores, and the site will calculate an average community score. There will also be a community section where you can upload your own reviews. Just keep in mind that everyone has their biases, so it’s always a good idea to check out multiple reviews from the site and other trustworthy sources.

This page will evolve as I acquire more products to review, so stay tuned for updates and new content!

                        This page will serve as a blog where I’ll share random thoughts, ideas, and updates, and I’d love to hear your feedback on them. The newspaper section will offer a newsletter sign-up where you can choose to receive updates on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis, depending on how many side projects I’m working on or how much new and interesting info comes out.

                        The newsletter is your way to stay in the loop—not just with my life, but also with everything I’m uploading or updating across all my platforms. It will cover everything from new content and updates on this website to changes on my other sites. You’ll get insights into what’s new, reasons behind any changes, and details on updated or newly added projects, videos, and more. Plus, subscribers will get early access codes for other planned projects, so you’ll be among the first to try out new developments.
                        
                        It’s the perfect way to stay connected with what I’m doing and never miss out on anything cool or important!

                        This project is inspired by a project ideas video and aligns with my goal of learning data analysis for my university course. I plan to build a personal finance tracker when I have more free time and am comfortable with the required skills. While it will start as a rough and evolving project, I’m excited about the potential and am committed to its development.

                        I’m building this website as a personal web portfolio and a platform for my diverse projects and interests. Starting on August 1st, 2024, I embarked on this journey to create a space where I could showcase my skills, share useful resources, and provide interactive tools for users. The site includes a range of features, such as game and tech reviews, a blog for updates and ideas, a personal finance tracker, and a productivity management system. By building this site myself, I’ve created a dynamic and evolving platform that reflects my passion for technology and personal development. It’s not only a portfolio to demonstrate my work but also a space where I can engage with a community and continuously improve based on feedback and new ideas.

                    <h2><a id="section10"></a>Travel booking system</h2>
                    <p> This upcoming project site will be your personal trip planner, designed to streamline your travel arrangements and make planning a breeze. It will allow you to search for flights with estimated prices, book hotels, and discover fun activities in your destination. The system will include a comprehensive planner to organize everything from flights and hotels to budgeting—integrating with the personal finance tracker to help you save for your dream vacation.

                        You’ll be able to create and download a holiday bucket list with all the relevant details and car rental options, and save your planned trips to revisit when flights are cheaper or when you’ve saved enough. The system will also link to your To-Do List and Productivity Management System, ensuring you stay on top of your work and school tasks before your holiday. All pre-booked activities will be added to a dedicated holiday to-do list, which syncs with your calendar, allowing you to manage your time effectively and enjoy your trip stress-free.
                        
                        Additional features will include viewing and booking cruises, discovering optional events like the Olympics or local free activities, and uploading and sharing photos and reviews of your trip. This project is still in concept phase, and development will begin once the necessary groundwork is completed. </p>

YouTube members or Twitch subscribers can access this content by sending an email inquiry with a code linked to their account. For those who are not subscribers, access can be purchased for $6 a month, with half of that amount donated to a charity chosen by the community through a monthly poll. Non-paying users can still access the content, but it will include ads.

                        This page will also serve as a live chat area for direct communication with me, offering an interactive platform for discussions and feedback. Subscribers will enjoy an ad-free experience along with additional closed beta privileges and premium features across most of my projects.
                        
                        Please note that this is currently a concept and will be developed over the next couple of months. Stay tuned for updates as work progresses!
